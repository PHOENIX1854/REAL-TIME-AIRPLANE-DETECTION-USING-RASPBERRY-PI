# REAL-TIME-AIRPLANE-DETECTION-USING-RASPBERRY-PI

Thrilled to share a real-time airplane detection system I recently deployed and tested on a Raspberry Pi, using the latest YOLOv11 model!

🔍 Key Features: ✅ Detects airplanes in live IP camera feeds
✅ Classifies airplane status as In Air, Landing, Landed & Moving, or At Rest
✅ Tracks airplane movement using position history
✅ Logs every detection in real time (MySQL + downloadable Excel log)
✅ Hosts a responsive web dashboard built with Flask to stream live video, view logs, and download reports

🛠️ Tech Stack:

YOLOv11 (Ultralytics)

OpenCV

Flask (for live streaming + interface)

MySQL & Pandas (for structured logging)

Raspberry Pi (edge deployment)

📡 The system runs entirely on the Pi—proving that even with limited resources, real-time computer vision + logging can be done efficiently!

💡 This project helped me dive deeper into embedded AI, real-time optimization, and full-stack integration for edge computing.

Looking forward to building on this and exploring more real-world CV applications!
